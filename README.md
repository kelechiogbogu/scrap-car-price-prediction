# Scrap Car Price Prediction

## Project Overview
This project predicts scrap car prices using Linear Regression. It includes data cleaning, processing, and evaluation of the model.

## Understanding the Data
Before building the model, I explored the dataset to understand its structure, features, and quality.

## Data Cleaning
I cleaned the data by removing unnecessary columns, grouping and correcting categorical variables, and fixing inconsistencies.

## Data Processing
I handled outliers, encoded categorical variables, separated features from the target, checked for multicollinearity, split the dataset into training and test sets, and applied feature scaling.

## Model Training & Evaluation
I trained a Linear Regression model. The R² score on the test set was 0.81, and cross-validation gave an average score of 0.80, showing the model is stable and predicts well.

## Summary
The model predicts scrap car prices reasonably well and serves as a solid baseline for further improvements.
